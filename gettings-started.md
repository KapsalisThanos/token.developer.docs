Get started with the Twitter developer platform
Twitter's Developer Platform enables you to harness the power of Twitter's open, global, real-time and historical communication network within your own applications. The platform provides tools, resources, data and API products for you to integrate, and expand Twitter's impact through research, solutions and more.

This section can help you get acquainted with the current platform organization, explains how to get access to the different tools and endpoints, and provides additional resources that can help you build with the Twitter API.
 

How the platform is organized
The Twitter developer platform is organized into four different products, based on use case, versioning, and access model. 

We have put together a different page for each product to help you get started, which you can access below:

This API allows you to find and retrieve, engage with or create a variety of different resources including the following:
Tweets

Direct Messages
Lists
Trends
Media
Places
 
We recently released Twitter API v2: Early Access with new versions of several endpoints that enable you to retrieve and search for Tweets.
 

The full Twitter API v1.1 is still available, and enables you to publish and engage with all the resources listed above.

Documentation organization
Our technical documentation has separate sections to help you work with each of these different products. In each section, you will find guides, libraries, API references, and other resources to help you get started.

Developer portal, projects, and Twitter developer apps
Authentication

Twitter IDs

For content display and Twitter actions on websites, the Twitter for Websites product consists of web embeds and tools to optimize Twitter links. You can learn more about the fundamentals of this product by navigating to the Twitter for Websites section of the docs.
