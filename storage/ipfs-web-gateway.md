# IPFS Web Gateway

Token's read-only IPFS Web Gateway acts as a bridge between traditional web browsers and InterPlanetary File System \(IPFS\). Through the gateway, Internet users can browse files and websites stored by third parties on the IPFS public network quickly and easily, without downloading any special software, as if they were stored in a traditional web server.
