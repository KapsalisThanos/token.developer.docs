# Developer apps

### What is a developer App? 

Accessing the APIs requires a set of credentials that you must pass with each request. These credentials can come in different forms depending on the type of authentication that is required by the specific endpoint that you are using. For example, user context requires an API key and secret and a set of access tokens that are specific to the user that you are making the request on behalf of. 

You will be generating these keys and tokens that you pass along with your API requests with a developer App. Each Twitter App will be able to generate its own API key and API secret key that you will use to make requests on behalf of the App, as well as access tokens and access token secret that you will use to make requests on behalf of the owning user.  


In addition to generating the keys and tokens necessary to make API requests, you will also be able to set access permissions, document the use case or purpose for the App, and modify other settings related to your App developer environment from within the management dashboard.

#### Dashboard

You can visit the dashboard to manage the Apps associated with your account. To learn more, please visit our documentation page on the dashboard. The dashboard allows developers to quickly and easily perform the following tasks:

* View your existing standalone Apps and their associated App ID.
* Create a new Project and App or standalone App.
* Delete an unused Project or App. 
* Review or update a specific App's settings, including updating name, desciption, website, callback URL and permissions.
* Regenerate App specific credentials like API key & Secret, bearer token, and app owner access tokens.

#### Projects and standalone Apps

Standalone Apps are Apps outside of the Project structure, that cannot access v2 endpoints. In order to access v2 newest endpoints, you will need to create a Project. Projects allow you to organize your work by use case and effectively manage your access to the API. If you have previously created Apps, they will be visible in the section entitled “Standalone Apps”. 

### Applying for access

If you need to create a new App, you will need to have an approved developer account.
