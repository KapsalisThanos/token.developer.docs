# Developer portal



### Introduction

The Token developer portal is a set of self-serve tools that developers can use to manage their access as well as to create and manage their Organizations and Apps.

In the portal, you have the opportunity to:

* Create and manage your Organizations and Apps.
* Set up your developer environments.
* Learn more about different endpoints and features available. 
  * In our [Twitter API section](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/portal/products), you will see a list of available endpoints. If you click on an endpoint you will be taken to a page that will show you key usage information and other documentation that can be helpful for you as you build with the API, such as quick start guides and migration guides.
  * In the [Labs section](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/account/labs), you can experiment with our newest endpoints and give us feedback to help shape the future of Token’s APIs.
* View [team](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/account/team) pages where you can add and manage the different handles that have access to your team's Premium APIs.

To get a Twitter developer account, please apply: Apply for a developer account

**Please note**: When applying, you will have to submit detailed use case information about your intended use of Twitter APIs. To get through the application process as quickly as possible, please make sure to be specific about what you are building.

#### App management

Developers can both create and manage Twitter Projects and Apps from the Dashboard in the developer portal. This is where you can find the App ID, edit an App's name, description, website, [callback URL](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/callback-urls.html), and set an App's access levels. Most importantly, this is where you can regenerate the API Key & Secret, bearer token or app owner access token if they are lost. 

Learn more about creating and managing your Apps in [Twitter Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/overview.html).

#### Premium usage

[**View your** ](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/account/subscriptions)**usage under the “account” section of the dashboard.**

The developer dashboard is an account-level view of your various premium subscriptions and their respective usage metrics.

For the [Premium Search API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/search/overview/premium.html), you can view the total number of requests you’ve made this billing period, as well as the estimated requests you’ll make by the end of the current billing period. You can also view what percent of your request and Tweet allotment for the current billing period has already been consumed, and when you used your requests throughout the period.  Actual Tweet volume delivered and projected for the period.

For the [Premium Account Activity API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/subscribe-account-activity/overview.html), you can view the number of subscriptions that you have used out of your total available subscriptions based on the tier.  The volume delivered through Account Activity is not measured. 

Using the drop-down menu in the top-left corner of the developer dashboard you can view request usage over different periods of time including the current month, the last 30 days, the last 24 hours, the last 120 minutes, and the past months. The developer dashboard and all requested usage are based on UTC time.



#### Dev environments

[**View the "Dev environments" page**](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/account/environments)

To begin using one of the APIs available in the developer portal, you need to set up a dev environment for the endpoint. All of the subscription API packages support at least one dev environment \(the number is dependent on the details of your package\), which can be used to isolate usage, rules, rate limits, or otherwise within your systems.   


Please note: It is a best practice to associate the products with an App owned by your business @handle to avoid future inconveniences.   


#### Team

**Available on 'Organization' developer accounts only.**  [**View the "Team" page**](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/account/team)**.**

From the team dashboard, you can manage developer access and edit the roles of the developers working on a premium application.    


On the "Active tab" of the team dashboard, you can remove developers from a team, invite users to join a team, change developer roles, and leave an account if desired. 

This tab will also allow you to review the current developers on the team, the role of given developers, and the day they were added to the team. On the "Invited tab" of the team dashboard, you can view the invitations that you have sent to developers, the date a developer was invited to join the team, and the status of their invite.

Currently, only Administrators have the ability to add/remove members of the team, upgrade/manage subscriptions, set up dev environments, and manage billing/payment methods. The developer’s role is limited to read-only access to the developer portal.

Team functionality is intended to facilitate collaborative development for premium APIs. Often teams have different people responsible for access control, development, billing/payments, etc. and this allows you to invite those people to contribute to your project.

Note: Team management does not currently grant/limit API access, which is based on [App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/overview.html) credentials.  It is not possible to share App management across your team. Currently the ‘team setup’ only Applies to the Premium API section; and not to the App management section.  Apps \(keys/tokens\) cannot be edited, created, or deleted by non-owners.

#### Team roles functionality, abilities, limitations:

Note: Team management does not currently include shared App credential view, edit, deletion abilities, or grant/limit API access, which is based on [App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/overview.html) credentials.
